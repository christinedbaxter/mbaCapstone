### Jupyter Notebook Plan

#### Phase 1: Data Preparation

##### Step 1: Import Libraries

First, we'll import the Python libraries that are needed for data manipulation and visualization.

\`\`\`python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
\`\`\`

##### Step 2: Load the Data

Next, the data from the Excel file is loaded into Python.

\`\`\`python
excel_file = 'path_to_file/CompetitionRoundsData.xlsx'
sheets_dict = pd.read_excel(excel_file, sheet_name=None)
\`\`\`

##### Step 3: Data Cleaning

Examine the data for missing or inconsistent values. Clean the data as needed.

\`\`\`python

##### Example: Remove rows where a key column might be missing

df = sheets_dict['Sheet_Name']
df_cleaned = df.dropna(subset=['Key_Column'])
\`\`\`

#### Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##### Step 4: Summary Statistics

Generate summary statistics to understand the dataset's distribution.

\`\`\`python
df_cleaned.describe()
\`\`\`

##### Step 5: Correlation Analysis

Find correlations between variables to understand relationships.

\`\`\`python
correlations = df_cleaned.corr()
sns.heatmap(correlations)
\`\`\`

#### Phase 3: Data Visualization

##### Step 6: Time Series Analysis

For data over a period, a time series graph will show trends.

\`\`\`python
plt.plot(df_cleaned['Year'], df_cleaned['Revenue'])
plt.title('Revenue Over Time')
plt.show()
\`\`\`

##### Step 7: Bar Charts

Use bar charts to compare different categories.

\`\`\`python
sns.barplot(x='Year', y='Revenue', data=df_cleaned)
\`\`\`

#### Phase 4: Insights and Recommendations

##### Step 8: Identify Key Takeaways

Based on the EDA and visualizations, identify key points that are worth noting.

##### Step 9: Formulate Recommendations

Use your findings to propose actions for the company.

#### Phase 5: Project Story and Presentation

##### Step 10: Compile Findings

Gather all the findings, charts, and recommendations into a cohesive project story.

##### Step 11: Present to Stakeholders

Use the compiled information to create a presentation or report that you can share with your team or management.
